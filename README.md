# ✈ Aircraft Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **machine learning application** designed to predict the price of aircraft based on key features such as production year, range, fuel consumption, capacity, and maintenance costs. The model is trained using a **Random Forest Regressor** and is deployed with a **Streamlit web app**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Explore aircraft data with detailed insights.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Predicts aircraft prices using trained `RandomForestRegressor`.
- **Streamlit Web App**: User-friendly interface for making predictions.
- **Scalable & Reproducible**: Includes all dependencies via `requirements.txt`.

## 📊 Model & Data Insights
The dataset contains various aircraft models with detailed specifications. The Jupyter Notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) provides:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature correlation heatmaps
- Model training & evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, R² Score)
- Predictions vs Actual visualization

## 🎯 Usage
1. Select an aircraft model in the Streamlit app.
2. Enter specifications (e.g., production year, fuel consumption, capacity).
3. Click "Predict Price" to get the estimated aircraft price.

## 🏗 Future Improvements
- Add more aircraft types & historical price data.
- Implement additional ML models for comparison.
- Enhance UI with better visualization tools.
